## Confidence Assessment

- Level: HIGH

- Score: 90/100

- Rationale: Promoted as HIGH confidence because matches default ui or extracted base ui surface, matches a known engine namespace, called globally with no local definition.

## Evidence Signals

- +35 Matches default UI or extracted base UI surface: Symbol aligns with known default-interface namespaces.
- +20 Called globally with no local definition: No addon-local definition was observed in the generated corpus.
- +25 Matches a known engine namespace: Namespace shape matches WAR engine APIs.
- +10 Argument pattern is consistent: Observed argument positions remain stable.
