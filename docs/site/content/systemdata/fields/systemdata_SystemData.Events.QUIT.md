# SystemData.Events.QUIT

- Category: SystemData Field
- Confidence level: HIGH
- Confidence score: 100/100
- Seen in: 1 addons

## Confidence Assessment

- Level: HIGH

- Final score: 100/100

- Raw weighted score: 143

- Rationale: Promoted as HIGH confidence because matches default ui or extracted base ui surface, matches a known engine namespace, referenced by generated docs or reference files.

## Evidence Signals

- +35 Matches default UI or extracted base UI surface: Symbol aligns with known default-interface namespaces.
- +20 Called globally with no local definition: No addon-local definition was observed in the generated corpus.
- +25 Matches a known engine namespace: Namespace shape matches WAR engine APIs.
- +18 Used in event registration or dispatch: Observed in event-driven engine hooks.
- +25 Referenced by generated docs or reference files: The symbol is reinforced outside a single call page.
- +20 Reinforced across multiple generated source types: Evidence comes from several independent addon-api source types.
