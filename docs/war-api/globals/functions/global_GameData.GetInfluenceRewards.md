# GameData.GetInfluenceRewards

- Category: Global Function
- Confidence level: HIGH
- Confidence score: 100/100
- Seen in: 2 addons

## Confidence Assessment

- Level: HIGH

- Final score: 100/100

- Raw weighted score: 131

- Rationale: Promoted as HIGH confidence because matches default ui or extracted base ui surface, matches a known engine namespace, called globally with no local definition.

## Evidence Signals

- +18 Seen in 2 to 3 addons: Cross-addon spread is present but limited.
- +35 Matches default UI or extracted base UI surface: Symbol aligns with known default-interface namespaces.
- +20 Called globally with no local definition: No addon-local definition was observed in the generated corpus.
- +25 Matches a known engine namespace: Namespace shape matches WAR engine APIs.
- +15 Role is consistent across addons: The same symbol serves the same kind of job across addons.
- +10 Argument pattern is consistent: Observed argument positions remain stable.
- +8 Return usage is consistent: Observed as a stable query-style API.

## Signature (inferred)

```lua
GameData.GetInfluenceRewards(arg1)
```

## Description

Observed as a global function across 2 addons.

## Parameters

| Name | Role | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| arg1 | Observed as a function or method reference. | Observed values: TomeWindow.WarJournal.CurEntryData.influenceId |

## Returns

- Observed as a query-style API. The concrete return shape is not inferable from contract artifacts alone.

## Side Effects

- No side effect is confidently inferable from contract artifacts alone.

## Seen In

- nLootLink
- nRarity

## Examples

- nLootLink: TomeWindow_UpdateActiveWarstoryEntryRewards -> GameData.GetInfluenceRewards(TomeWindow.WarJournal.CurEntryData.influenceId)
- nRarity: getItemData -> GameData.GetInfluenceRewards(TomeWindow.WarJournal.CurEntryData.influenceId)

## Notes

- Canonical entry built from observed call sites, not from engine source or decompiled definitions.
