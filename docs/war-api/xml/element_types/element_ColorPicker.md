# ColorPicker

- Category: XML Element Type
- Confidence level: HIGH
- Confidence score: 100/100

## Confidence Assessment

- Level: HIGH

- Final score: 100/100

- Raw weighted score: 108

- Rationale: Promoted as HIGH confidence because matches default ui or extracted base ui surface, used directly in xml handler attributes, referenced by generated docs or reference files.

## Evidence Signals

- +35 Matches default UI or extracted base UI surface: Symbol aligns with known default-interface namespaces.
- +30 Used directly in XML handler attributes: XML exposure suggests an engine-level contract.
- +18 Used in event registration or dispatch: Observed in event-driven engine hooks.
- +20 Observed in both XML and Lua paths: Cross-source linkage reinforces platform-level usage.
- +25 Referenced by generated docs or reference files: The symbol is reinforced outside a single call page.
- -20 Only one weak usage site: Evidence is too shallow to trust as platform API.
